[![Run on Repl.it](https://repl.it/badge/github/TelmoElmo/CSRepl)](https://repl.it/github/TelmoElmo/CSRepl)
Does not run properly on repl.it yet as I'm still trying to get it to just run the right folder.
When on repl.it you must drag the 'main.py' from the subfolder to the root directory before you run it.
When on repl.it ensure only one main.py file is in the root directory at a given time.
